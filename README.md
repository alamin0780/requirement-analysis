# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developerâ€™s ability to Master the 
principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis (also often called Requirements Engineering) is a foundational and critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of all stakeholders for a new or modified software product.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is not just a preliminary step; it's the cornerstone of a successful software project. It prevents building the wrong thing, controls costs, fosters collaboration, and ultimately leads to a higher-quality product that genuinely serves its purpose. Neglecting this phase is a common recipe for project 
failure

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Elicitation: Gathering needs from stakeholders (users, clients, etc.) through interviews, workshops, observation.
2. Analysis: Examining collected requirements for clarity, completeness, consistency, and feasibility.
3. Documentation: Recording requirements formally, often in an SRS, specifying functional and non-functional needs.
4. Validation: Confirming with stakeholders that documented requirements accurately reflect their true needs.
5. Management: Tracking changes to requirements and ensuring traceability throughout the project.

# Types of Requirements
## Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements define what the system must do. They specify the behaviors, features, and capabilities a software product needs to exhibit to meet user needs and business objectives.
## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional Requirements (NFRs), in contrast to functional requirements, define how well the system performs or the quality attributes of the software. They don't specify what the system does, but rather the conditions under which it operates, its characteristics, and its constraints.

# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram type used in software engineering to visually represent the functionality of a system from an external user's perspective.

# Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria (AC) are predefined conditions or requirements that a software feature, user story, or increment of work must satisfy to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders (users, clients, product owner)
